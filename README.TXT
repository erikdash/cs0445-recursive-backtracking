The test methods check all possible cases and scenarios that I could find for each method.
After running the test methods, all of my methods appear to be working correctly. When running large.txt 9, the process
took very long, and hadn't found a solution after 45 minutes. The program was able to find solutions for large.txt
for all coupon quantities greater than 9 and less than 26 (the maximum number of coupons) in under a minute.
